# VBA

Some basic functions I put together from stackoverflow mainly.

backup.bas copies the whole file and adds a timestamp to the filename of the copy.

clearSheets.bas deletes every row of the sheet starting from the 5th.

importCSV.bas imports a CSV file to a sheet. I got it from stackoverflow, but use it often enough, so I thought I'll include it.

sort.bas sorts specific rows by two different keys in the appropriate order of priorities, and then renumbers the index column.
